# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing "freies Brainstorming mit deinem ki assistenten" function on the content ideas page to create a more intelligent, context-aware content generation system. Instead of generic brainstorming, the system will analyze recent chat messages to understand user context and generate highly relevant, personalized content ideas including scripts, hashtags, captions, and implementation guides. The interface will be redesigned to be clean, professional, and Ã¼bersichtlich (easy to handle).
